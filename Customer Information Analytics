#Below shows how I queried a database and joined multiple tables to quantify statistics about customers and their order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON c.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, price, sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON Feb.orderid=c.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
