#Below shows how I queried a database and joined multiple tables to quantify statistics about customers and their order data. 

-- How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON c.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, price, sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON Feb.orderid=c.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

-- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, location, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

--Which locations in New York recieved at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each recieve? 
SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like '%NY%' AND length(orderid)=6 AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderid)>2;

--How many od each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

--What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT AVG(price*quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb 
JOIN BIT_DB.customers c

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT AVG(quantity)

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT distinct product, SUM(quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) desc;
