-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- List the track names based on danceability from highest to lowest
SELECT artist_name, danceability, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--On average how many tracks does each artist have in the list?
SELECT COUNT(track_name), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
